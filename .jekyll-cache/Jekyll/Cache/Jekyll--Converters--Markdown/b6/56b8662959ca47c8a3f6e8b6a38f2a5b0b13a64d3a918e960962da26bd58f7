I"Ú<p>When your product gets traction, youâ€™ll  nd yourself inundated with good ideas for features. These will come from your customers, your colleagues, and yourself. Because theyâ€™re good ideas, there will always be lots of reasons to say yes to them. <strong>Hereâ€™s 12 arguments that are commonly used to sneak features into a product</strong>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>But the data looks good</li>
  <li>But itâ€™ll only take a few minutes</li>
  <li>But this customer is about to quit</li>
  <li>But we can just make it optional</li>
  <li>But my cousinâ€™s neighbour saidâ€¦</li>
  <li>But weâ€™ve nothing else planned</li>
  <li>But weâ€™re supposed to be allowed to work on whatever we want</li>
  <li>But 713,000 people want it</li>
  <li>But our competitors already have it</li>
  <li>But if we donâ€™t build it, someone else will</li>
  <li>But the boss really wants it</li>
  <li>But this could be â€œthe oneâ€</li>
</ol>
