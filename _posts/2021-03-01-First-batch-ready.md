A couple of weeks had passed since I decided to start with the dissasemble of the [PR-5000](/2021/Panasonic-PR-5000-project.html). This is the first update.

No many surprises so far: seatpost and stem are not stuck; Shimano 600 tricolor groupset complete (not sure about the bottom bracket yet); original Panasonic bottle cage. Didn't check the wheels so far (they are Atala).

Started by dissasembling brakes (beatiful I must say), cables and the transmission. They are already dissasembled/degreased, cleaned, assembled/greased again. Same with the cable housings. I got a new set of cables (transmission/brakes) that they were totally destroyed.

~~Front derallieur~~
~~Cables & levers~~
~~Chain~~
~~Cog~~

Pretty useful the [Shimano website](https://si.shimano.com/#/) to find all the parts and pieces of each component. In this case, the rear derallieur

I was not able to take out the pedals. They are pretty stuck and I don't have enough leverage with my tools. I'll see what I can do. Same with crackset.

The brake handles rubber housings were removed. They were pretty dirty, but a good clean up with detergent and as next step with CIF will do the job. I've tried to get replacements, but they are really hard to find and specially in white.

Next stop: probably the wheelset to check aligment, cones, bearigns, inner tubes and tyres. That could be a couple of mornings (need to go out and cycle too).

## Checklist
### Wheelset:
- Hubs and bearings
- Tyres + alignment

### Frame:
- Seat & Seatpost
- Cockpit
- Frame itself

### Transmission:
- Bottom Bracket (?)
- Crankset (x_x)
- Pedals (x_x)
