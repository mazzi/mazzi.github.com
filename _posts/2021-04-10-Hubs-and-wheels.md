Surprised about the quality of the Shimano hubs. With hubs cones and bearings cleaned and assembled, I have the feeling that they run smotther than the Campagnolos from the same era. Changed the bearings for new ones. They seem to run forever.

More diagrams from the [Shimano website](https://si.shimano.com/#/).

The wheels look aligned. Until the last stage of the build, I will keep the Vittoria tyres to move the bike around. Nevertheless, pretty hard to get new tyres online nowadays. Looking for new 700x23c gum wall.

~~Tyres + alignment~~

Got a new set of long allen keys to dissasemble the cockpit. Pretty nice system from Shimano to hide bolts.

Next step: Cockpit & Headset. Probably the last dirty job until I decided if I dive into the bottom bracket or not.
