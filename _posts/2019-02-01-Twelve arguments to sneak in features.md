When your product gets traction, you’ll  nd yourself inundated with good ideas for features. These will come from your customers, your colleagues, and your- self. Because they’re good ideas, there will always be lots of reasons to say yes to them. **Here’s 12 arguments that are commonly used to sneak features into a product**:

1. But the data looks good
2. But it’ll only take a few minutes
3. But this customer is about to quit
4. But we can just make it optional
5. But my cousin’s neighbour said...
6. But we’ve nothing else planned
7. But we’re supposed to be allowed to work on whatever we want
8. But 713,000 people want it
9. But our competitors already have it
10. But if we don’t build it, someone else will
11. But the boss really wants it
12. But this could be “the one”
