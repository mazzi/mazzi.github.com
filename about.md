Hi, my name is Lautaro Mazzitelli and I'm a Software Engineer.
Team player in different roles. Developer, Coach, Facilitator, Public Speaker, University Teacher, Product person.

Most of the projects that I worked on in my professional career can be read in my
[linkedin profile](http://www.linkedin.com/in/lmazzitelli), found on this blog or in [my github profile](https://www.github.com/mazzi). Regarding code, most of what I produced is owned by my previous employers and unfortunately it's not open source (in fact, it's private code). Still you can find [projects or contributions that I worked on](https://mazzi.github.io/projects.html) on this site.

I've worked on different languages, database engines and technologies. _It's the indian, not the arrow._

You can get in touch using one of these:

1. <lmazzitelli@pm.me>
2. [linkedin.com/lmazzitelli](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lmazzitelli)
3. [github.com/mazzi](https://www.github.com/mazzi)
4. [keybase.io/mazzi](https://keybase.io/mazzi)
5. [GPG public key](./lmazzitelli.asc).

Besides 💻, I like 🍃, 🧗‍♂️, ⛰️, [🎶](http://www.keithfem.com), 🚴‍♂️, 🛠️ and learning new things.

***caveat***: I'm not an english native speaker. Sorry for any grammar or <em>spilleng</em> errors that you can find.
