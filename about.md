Interested in innovative projects and development. Team player in different roles. Developer, Coach, Facilitator, Public Speaker, University Teacher, Product person.
I'm a Software Engineer. Most of the projects that I worked on in my professional carreer can be read in my
[linkedin profile](http://www.linkedin.com/in/lmazzitelli), found on this blog or in [my github profile](https://www.github.com/mazzi). Regarding code, most of what I produced is owned by my previous employers and unfortunatly it's not open source (in fact, it's private code). I've worked on different languages, database engines and technologies.
Still you can find [projects or contributions that I worked](https://mazzi.github.io/projects.html) on his site.

You can reach me through the following means:

1. <lmazzitelli@pm.me>
2. [linkedin.com/lmazzitelli](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lmazzitelli)
3. [github.com/mazzi](https://www.github.com/mazzi)
4. [keybase.io/mazzi/](https://keybase.io/mazzi/)
5. [GPG public key](./lmazzitelli.asc).

[I don't have a Facebook account](http://edition.cnn.com/2013/02/25/opinion/rushkoff-why-im-quitting-facebook). It's a pretty old article (2013). Nowadays you can find a lot more reasons about not having a Facebook account.
