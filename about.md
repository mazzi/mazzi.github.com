title: About Lautaro Mazzitelli (mazzi)
---

I'm a software engineer. Most of the things that I made in my professional carreer can be read in my
[linkedin profile](http://www.linkedin.com/in/lmazzitelli).

Why this blog? To write about things that I learn from my co-workers, friends and my own experience.

Thanks to [dfgonzalez](http://www.dfgonzalez.com.ar) for the simple layout of this blog :)
